Title: What to do with this blog?

Excerpts: ActivityPub? More blog? TIL(s)?


I am planning to use this blog as my digital garden. I am very much influenced by this blog [post.](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) There will be 2 types of post that I wanted to start posting more frequently:

1. TIL(s) / daily log
2. Lesson learned or review

Oh and also I'll be adding RSS to this badboi, maybe turn this into an activitypub (?) Who knows :D
