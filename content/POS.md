Excerpts: A sell-everything kind of platform
Category: Blog

I am always interested in building a Point Of Sales kind of system but lately the itch grows exponentially. I have been annoyed by those "scan QR in the table to order" apps; from bad UX to down right not functional. Let's document it here.

Some annoyance I faced as a user:

- I need to download 40MBs of PDF to see menu. Fuck this shit
- Ordering experience is bad:
  - Bloated UI
  - No real feedback when I order.
  - Paying is a mess. Even saweria is better existing solution.
  - For the love of god, no way to split bills.

Some goals:

- I want it to be able to be used by restaurants and also just shop in general.
- Better order experience:
  - Multi user can order for the party
  - Quick feedback if the order is successfully submitted
  - Integrate QRIS for payment with split bills enabled

Let's see how this turns out. :)
