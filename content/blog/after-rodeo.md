I want to write a few things that I discovered after running my first solo rodeo.

### On Company Logistics:

- It's a pet vs. cattle debate; love the company name, yet after acquisition, it isn't mine.
- I paid myself minimally. Use dividends to pull money out of the company. A 10% final tax rate in Indonesia is pretty cool.
- Outsource legal and accounting so you can focus on building.
- Getting police summons is something I will never get used to. Glad its over.

### On Building:

- Modern hardware is fast. Do whatever necessary to ship.
- I used Python for BE and JS on the front; I kinda resent this decision. Let's revisit the idea of using one language for everything.
- Integration testing is all you need.
- Make sure it's pretty; I didn't do a great job at this.
- Being lean is a superpower; if you are technical, just learn the non-technical part and vice versa.
- Tailscale is another super power.
- Your users usually don't know what they want. I get better insights by observing their recordings rather than asking questions. Support messages should go to you. Read them. Get triggered. Do something about it.
- Dashboard is overrated. ChatOps all the way. We utilized a Discord bot for internal tools. Pretty awesome.
- Use SSO from day one.
- Use a password manager to share card/other important login information.
