Title: Appointment

A week ago, I scheduled an appointment to see a dentist. I scheduled it for a workday at noon. I was there on time, and told to wait. Twenty minutes and an uncomfortable conversation later, the nurse realized that there was a scheduling error. This guy name was in my 'supposed' slot and made it to the clinic earlier than me. They only found this error after backtracking and found my whatsapp message which was earlier than this guy.

### What went wrong?

I was told that this is their workflow: the appointment was made over a Whatsapp chat. The nurse then needs to 'copy' that appointment into a calendar app. Unfortunately for me, it failed to book that slot under my name so the slot was open. He said it is no big deal, this is not the first time it happened and I can get another schedule next week.

As a software guy, it drives me nuts that this a user can forgave a calendar app that failed to do its purpose regularly.
